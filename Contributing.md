This project is being mentored by [Meet Patel](https://github.com/meet59patel) and [Hemang Nakarani](https://github.com/HemangNakarani) under the Semester Long Projects by [DSC-DAIICT](https://slop.dscdaiict.in/)

<b> Please follow this guideline while contributing to the project,not adhering to these may result in loss of points</b>

## General instructions

- To start working on any issue, please comment under that issue and start working <b>ONLY</B> after [Meet Patel](https://github.com/meet59patel) or [Hemang Nakarani](https://github.com/HemangNakarani) assign you the issue.
- If someone makes a PR without being assigned that issue, that PR won't be awarded any points and won't even be considered valid. We'll be putting up strict measures to ensure everyone gets fair chance to make contributions.
- At a time only one issue will be assigned to one participant. Solve that and you can move forward with next one.
- This project is very well in its initial stage, so we'd love your inputs about feature requests or ideas. Please keep making suggestions, we'll definitely hear you out. This group should thrive with healthy discussions. PLease follow the guidelines for issues.
- Please prefer sending messages about the project in group only. This is also a general advice in open source. Do not hesitate to ask doubts in here. Personal texts only limit the reach of mentor and others stay uninformed about happenings in the project. However, you're welcome to talk about anything that's personal in the direct messages.

## Git Commands to get you started 

1. Fork the repository 
2. Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/meet59patel/schooler
```
3. Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd schooler
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-name/feature/bug>
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-contributing
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)
4.  Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier
