## General instructions

- To start working on any issue, please comment under that issue and start working ONLY after [Meet Patel](https://github.com/meet59patel) or [Hemang Nakarani](https://github.com/HemangNakarani) assign you the issue.
- If someone makes a PR without being assigned that issue, that PR won't be awarded any points and won't even be considered valid. We'll be putting up strict measures to ensure everyone gets fair chance to make contributions.
- At a time only one issue will be assigned to one participant. Solve that and you can move forward with next one.
- This project is very well in its initial stage, so we'd love your inputs about feature requests or ideas. Please keep making suggestions, we'll definitely hear you out. This group should thrive with healthy discussions. PLease follow the guidelines for issues.
- Please prefer sending messages about the project in group only. This is also a general advice in open source. Do not hesitate to ask doubts in here. Personal texts only limit the reach of mentor and others stay uninformed about happenings in the project. However, you're welcome to talk about anything that's personal in the direct messages.
